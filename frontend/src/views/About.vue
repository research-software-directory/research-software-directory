      <h2>No science without software</h2>

      <p>
        Much of modern day science would not be possible without the use of
        computers, and as a result, many scientists spend a significant part of
        their time writing code. During the past 5 years or so since the
        Netherlands eScience Center first started working with scientists, some
        patterns related to research software have emerged.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, research software often contains components that are quite
        generic in their application. To give you some idea, this may include
        components to connect to remote systems, to couple dynamic models or to
        parallelize computations. In the 100+ projects we have done so far, we
        see many implementations of what is functionally the same thing. What's
        more, the code quality often leaves something to be desired. For
        example, there are typically no tests, documentation is often lacking,
        and the code does not usually adhere to any coding standards. This isn't
        to say that the scientists who wrote such code did a bad job, but rather
        it is the natural result of what scientists are judged on, namely the
        scientific quality of the papers they put out, as opposed to the quality
        of software that enables such papers.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, one of the goals that the Netherlands eScience Center has set
        itself, is to identify such components, generalize them, and increase
        their software engineering quality to the point where they can be
        re-used by scientists from a broad variety of backgrounds. This way,
        scientists can spend what limited time they have on developing and
        testing their scientific ideas, as opposed to struggling with coding
        problems that have nothing to do with their scientific challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a while, we thought (naively perhaps) that as long as we would do a
        good job of improving the software engineering, surely we would see our
        tools being integrated into newly developed scientific software. So far
        though, adoption of our tools has mostly been limited to people that we
        are already involved with, for example because we do a project with
        them, or because they have consulted us on how their software can better
        address the scientific challenges they are facing, or because they have
        attended one of our symposia. While this is a good start, we also want
        to help scientists with whom we are not directly involved. To do so, we
        want to make sure that our software can be found online.
      </p>

      <h2>On finding software</h2>

      <p>
        Scientists, like most people these days, depend on search engines
        whenever they are looking for information on something. However, search
        engines are not very good when it comes to helping people find software.
        Problems exist both on the 'asking' side and on the 'answering' side of
        a query for software. On the asking side, using the correct terminology
        is difficult for scientists unfamiliar with computer science vocabulary.
        On the answering side, the software you are looking for might not be
        listed in the search results even if it exists on a software repository
        website such as GitHub, SourceForge, or BitBucket. This is because
        search engines have only a limited understanding of the code contained
        within such repositories. A second problem on the answering side is how
        to differentiate between the websites listed in the search results, and
        how to recognize the answer to your question when you see it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is not immediately obvious how to mitigate the problem on the asking
        side, but the problems on the answering side can be addressed by
        generating new web content. This new content, which we call the
        <i>Research Software Directory</i>, should describe software packages
        using generic language as much as possible, and should answer questions
        that researchers may have, such as "What can this tool do for me?", "Are
        other people in my field using it and what are they using it for?", and
        "Where do I go to get started?". Furthermore, software packages should
        be presented in their scientific context, by linking it to authors,
        publications, other software tools, blog posts, or whatever other
        content exists that may be relevant to the software package being
        presented. The Research Software Directory will accomplish two things:
        first, it helps researchers to quickly judge if a software package is
        relevant to their particular problem. Second, it will help search
        engines understand what a given software package is about, thereby
        improving the chances of earning a prominent place among the search
        results.
      </p>

      <h2>Visible impact</h2>

      <p>
        As a fortunate side-effect of presenting each tool in its scientific
        context, the Research Software Directory can be used to quickly gain a
        qualitative understanding of a tool's impact in the broadest sense of
        the word. This is important both for funders and for developers. Funders
        want to make sure that resources are granted such that maximum impact
        can be achieved, while developers benefit from being able to show that
        their software actually gets used as an integral part of scientific
        output.
      </p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>

      <p>
        Other scientific institutions could benefit from having their own
        Research Software Directory, but usually lack the resources required to
        develop such a platform. Therefore, we made our complete software stack
        available to others, free of charge. Visit
